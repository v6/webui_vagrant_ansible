I have been at work on this for a little while, and ran into some snags with the Vagrant build. 

I also installed the Yeoman build manager on my own machine. 

Turns out, removing the use of nfs from the vagrant file in the git repo, installing nfs, restarting the computer, deleting the repository, and re-cloning it again allowed me to build the thing successfully.
